# Install

To install Clio language, you'll need Node.js and NPM. After installing Node and NPM, you can install Clio by running:

## Bleeding Edge Installation

Clio is in active development and installation is only recommended for testing, early adopting and development so it is recommended to install from git before we reach a stable version one release.

To install from git, you'll need Node.js, NPM and git. You need to clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/clio-lang/clio`

 Then `cd` to the project directory:

`cd clio`

 Now you need to install dependencies, to do that run:

`npm install`

 Now you need to link the `clio` executable:

`npm link`
